# project_eva
project_eva created for the Copenhagen Business School bachelor course "Distributed Systems": https://kursuskatalog.cbs.dk/2016-2017/BA-BINTO1067U.aspx 

project_eva is supposed to show capabilities in creating a server and a client that can communicate with each other. 
It also requires to integrate relevant thoughts and decisions with regards to privacy, security and modularity. 

The project tries to integrate CBS Calendar with the possibility for students to rate every teaching session to hopefully mitigate and improve course throughout semester. 

At creation time it had access to CBS Calendar's API to be able to parse in all courses in local database.
